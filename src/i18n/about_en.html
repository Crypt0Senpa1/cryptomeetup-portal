<h3>1. New Beta Coming Up</h3>
<p>This round of testing will open 249 countries and each country token's price starts from 0.1 EOS and each purchase raises 35% to the next selling price. The price inflation becomes the profit, and will be split into several pots：</p>
<ul>
  <li> 50% to the last token owner </li>
    <li> 30% to the CMU token holder </li>
    <li> 10% to the pot (prize pool) </li>
    <li> 5% to the last owner of the alpha test </li>
    <li> 5% to the referrer </li>
</ul>
<p> The new round of testing adds a countdown timer and each purchase will reset the timer. The countdown time is related to the size of the prize pool, following t = 1 min + 24 hrs - pot / 2000 * 23.59 hrs, reducing from 24 hours to 1 minute.</p>

<p> Notice：When the timer reaches zero, last person to buy the land wins the prize pool and all land data during the testing round will be deleted. Users’ CMU Token won’t be affected.</p>
